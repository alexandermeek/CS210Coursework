To RUN:
in the src directory run:
main
---
if you wish to specify k,m,n then provide them as program arguements.
For example:
for 3 consumer threads, shared memory size of 4, and 400 numbers to produce run:
main 3 4 400

NOTE: k can only be 2 or 3 (if you wanted more they would have to be programmed)
